### Install - Create project



**I can see there is **_**different ways to start**_** a project.**

If you want something quick to test you may want to try a plunker, jsfiddle, codepen, jsbin... etc

[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/CruzJT/dhqa7L1b/2/)

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/Zurc/pen/qjoXWK)

[JSBin](http://jsbin.com/biroyuk/edit?html,js,output)



**From your editor**

**CDN**

CDN: [https://unpkg.com/vue](https://unpkg.com/vue)

**CLI**

You may want to start straight away using something like [vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)



**From scratch**

... or you want to start from scratch building everything to understand it better...
