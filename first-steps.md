Let's start from a clean component...

delete all but v-app tags inside your App.vue file template tags and leave an empty return on your script

v-something is particular way from vuetify to write their components \(elements\)

--

Check [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/) page to see all the available components and which ones you want to start with...

e.g. lets add a toolbar, this is as simple as writing...

```
<toolbar></toolbar>
```

You'll find all the components and demo code in their page.
