### Setting the project

This project is following this Academind great tutorial

Let's start by going to [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/) a package that implements **material design for VueJS.**

Follow 'get started' call to action button

There is a few options to get up and running with a project using CDN, vue-cli \(with different pre-made themes\) and even how to implement vuetify if you already have a project

Let's go for the vue-cli &gt; webpack advanced theme \(out of the box linting and unit testing\).

At the end of this code you can add a name for your project

```
$  vue init vuetifyjs/webpack-advanced
```

There is a few options offered to complete and choose for your project. Choose whatever is more convenient for you.

cd into your project folder and run

```
npm install
```

Once it is installed you can run your development server and view your dummy application in the browser

```
npm run dev
```

That's it, done!
